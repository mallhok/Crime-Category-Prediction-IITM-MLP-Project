As a part of the Machine Learning Practices Project for IITM's Online Diploma in Data Science, I participated in a Kaggle Competition to predict the crime categories for the given dataset. The Kaggle Notebook here is quite comprehensive and has been written in a way that makes it easy to read and understand.
